# Introduction

Hello! This is a small set of Godot tools and utilities I use to speed up my game development. Maybe they'll be useful to you, too. 

I'll keep updating this repository as I make more games and flesh out the tools that are already here. In addition, there's also a test level so you can see for yourself how the feature works in a real game setting.

Please check out [owengames.com](https://owengames.com/) or visit may page on [itch.io](https://oman276.itch.io/) to play the games that these tools built. 

Thanks for checking this out!

Current Plugin Version: 1.0.0
