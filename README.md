# Introduction

Hello! This is a small set of Godot tools and utilities I use to speed up my game development. Maybe they'll be useful to you, too. 

I'll keep updating this repository as I make more games and flesh out the tools that are already here.

Please check out owengames.com to play the games that these tools built. 

Thanks for checking this out!

# Current Utilities

## Owen Camera

This is a simple 2D camera that can smoothly track nodes without the feeling that the camera is "glued" to the object. Best used for 2D action games.
